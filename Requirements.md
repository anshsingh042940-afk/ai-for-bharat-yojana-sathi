## Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Millions of eligible citizens in India fail to access government welfare schemes due to:
- **Awareness Gap**: Limited knowledge of available schemes
- **Complexity Barrier**: Convoluted eligibility criteria and documentation requirements
- **Language Barriers**: Information available only in English or limited regional languages
- **Navigation Difficulty**: Complex government portals requiring digital literacy
- **Ineffective Support**: Inadequate grievance mechanisms and guidance systems

### Current State Analysis
While platforms like UMANG provide scheme information, they operate as static repositories without:
- Personalized eligibility assessment
- Contextual guidance based on user circumstances
- Decision support for complex scenarios
- Natural language interaction capabilities

This gap results in:
- Exclusion of rightful beneficiaries
- Dependency on middlemen and informal facilitators
- Increased application rejection rates
- Reduced trust in government digital services
